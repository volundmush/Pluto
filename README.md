# Pluto
Pluto is a fork of the Lua 5.4.4 programming language. Internally, it's mostly PUC-Rio Lua 5.4, but as I continue to make small modifications, over time it'll be its own little thing. This is why I ascribed the name 'Pluto', because it'll always be something small & neat. The main changes right now are expansions to Lua's syntax, but performance optimizations and QoL features like optional compile-time warnings are under development too.

Pluto will not have a heavy focus on light-weight and embeddability, but it'll be kept in mind. I intend on adding features to this that'll make Lua (or in this case, Pluto) more general-purpose and bring more attention to the Lua programming language, which I deeply love. Pluto will not grow to the enormous size of Python, obviously, but the standard library will most definitely be expanded. So far, many operators have been added & overhauled. There are new virtual machine optimizations, new syntax such as lambda expressions & string indexing, and more that you can read below.

### Note
This is a learner's project concerning the internals of Lua. I will often add and change things simply to learn more about my environment. As a result, there will be breaking changes very often. There may be bugs, and there will be design choices that people probably don't agree with. However, this will become a good base to write more Lua patches from. I do welcome other people in using Pluto as a reference for their own Lua patches — because Pluto offers some neat improvements over Lua already.

## Breaking changes:
- `!=` is the new inequality operator.
- The `^` operator now performs bitwise XOR instead of exponentiation.
- The former `~=` inequality operator has been changed to an augmented bitwise NOT assignment.
## New Features:
### Dedicated Exponent Operator
The `**` operator has been implemented into the operator set. It has replaced the previous use of '^'.
### Arbitrary Characters in Numeral Literals
Long numbers can get confusing to read for some people. `1_000_000` is now a valid alternative to `1000000`.
### String Indexing
String indexing makes character-intensive tasks nearly 3x faster. The syntax is as follows:
```lua
local str = "hello world"
assert(str[5] == "o")
assert(str[200] == nil)
```
This is a very nice addition because it avoids a lookup and function call for each character. Things like (i.e, hash algorithms) will significantly benefit from this change.
### Lambda Expressions
Without the size constraint of Lua, there's no need to hold weary of shorthand expressions.
Here's example usage of the new lambda expressions:
```lua
local str = "123"
local inc_str = str:gsub(".", |c| -> tonumber(c) + 1)
assert(inc_str == "234")
```
- The '|' token was chosen because it's not commonly used as an unary operator in programming.
- The '->' arrow syntax looked better and didn't resemble any operators. It also plays along with common lambda tokens.
### Compiler Warnings
Pluto now offers optional compiler warnings for certain misbehaviors. Currently, this is applied only to duplicated local definitions. These internal checks are faster, and more reliable than analytical third-party software. Compiler warnings need to be explicity enabled with the `-D` flag. For an example, see this code:
```lua
local a = "hello world"
do
    local a = "shadowed"
end
```
Given you run the file like this: `pluto -D file.plu`, the parser will emit the following message to standard error output:
```
WARNING: file.plu:3: duplicated local definition ('a') implies value shadowing.
```
This feature can be removed from Pluto via the `PLUTO_PARSER_WARNING_LOCALDEF` macro in `luaconf.h`.
### Augmented Operators
The following augmented operators have been added:
- Modulo: `%=`
- Addition: `+=`
- Bitwise OR: `|=`
- Subtraction: `-=`
- Bitwise XOR: `^=`
- Bitwise NOT: `~=`
- Bitshift left: `<<=`
- Bitwise AND: `&=`
- Float division: `/=`
- Bitshift right: `>>=`
- Multiplication: `*=`
- Integer division: `//=`

These are all syntactic sugar for the usual binary operation & manual assignment, as such they produce nearly the same bytecode. In some instances, Pluto's augmented operators are faster than Lua. This happens because augmented operators temporarily store the left-hand operand inside of a register & share the value to the expression, whereas Lua would request the value twice.
## Optimizations:
### For Loops
Xmilia Hermit discovered an interesting for loop optimization on June 7th, 2022. It has been implemented in Pluto.
For example, take this code:
```lua
local t = {}
for i = 1, 10000000 do
    t[i] = i
end

local hidetrace
local start = os.clock()
for key, value in ipairs(t) do
    hidetrace = key
    hidetrace = value
end
print(os.clock() - start)
```
It takes roughly 650ms to run on my machine. Following the VM optimization, it takes roughly 160ms.
This optimization takes place in any loop that doesn't access the TBC variable returned by the `pairs` and `ipairs` function. See these returns:
```
pairs: next, table, nil, nil
ipairs: ipairsaux, table, integer, nil
```
When the latter `nil` TBC variable is never accessed, this optimization will occur.
## Standard Library Additions
### `_G`
- `newuserdata` function.
### `string`
- `endswith` function.
- `startswith` function.
